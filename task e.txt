First your question was how I will approach this testing.
First of all I would create a test strategy for this project, and answer a few basic questions. What is the scope of this testing, who will review the document?
Who will approve this document? What are the roles and responsibilities of each team member. What types of Testing ( Load testing, Security testing, Performance testing etc.) will i use etc.
What is critical to work on this app for my opinion would be search field, to ensure that "filter" button is working well, which means that if i press "filter" button i will be landed on the searched result.Then if i click on any single picture does the app provide me that picture in new outlook with better view.
Also i will test if the results of one author match the real pictures that he has in this app. Let's say that will be the first thing that I will test in some smoke testing. If we are talking about sanity testing i would check some less critical functions and their behavior.
I also wanna highlight that the code i wrote is some basic stuff that i will check on the first look on the site.
If I have some real projects I will have JIRA tool with tickets and the easiest way to track and do the testing step by step. 
Again when it comes to testing this site i will start with checking if buttons and search fields are working and giving expected results.
Then will check how the app works when i select one author, do i have expected results.
